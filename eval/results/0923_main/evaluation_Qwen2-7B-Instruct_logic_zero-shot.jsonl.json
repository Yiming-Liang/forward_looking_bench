For \\(n\\) propositional variables, m0 corresponds to the assignment of truth values that gives \\(2^n = 16\\) for 4 variables, since \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\nGiven these conditions:\n\n- Formula A being a tautology means it includes all 2^4 = 16 paired conjunctive terms, which aligns with the definition of being a tautology.\n- A basic formula includes the m0 term, meaning it is true for the assignment of truth values \\(p = q = r = s = \\text{true}\\) for 4 propositional variables.\n\nThus, if a formula A with 4 propositional variables is both a tautology and a basic form, it must include each of the 16 m0 terms (corresponding to all possible combinations of truth values that satisfy the specific conditions of the tautology and basic formula definitions).\n\nGiven the format requested is [[]], this is essentially describing a set or collection of m0 terms (since each term m0 corresponds to a specific set of truth assignments across all 4 variables). However, since m0 is specific to one particular truth assignment (all variables true), and based on the given instructions, the answer would practically describe the nature of such a formula rather than listing terms individually:\n\n**Answer:**\nSince the question requires an answer in the form [[]] and seeks a logical implication rather than a literal list of identifiers ([m0]), the response should clarify the nature of the formula in the described format, albeit unconventional.\n\nThe nature described is \"a formula that includes all possible true assignments across 4 variables\" which is logically aligned with the definitions given for tautologies and basic forms, thus applying uniquely to m0's presence given the constraints. To be explicit in terms of satisfying the interpreted criteria and the instruction format, while recognizing the nature of direct listing may vary, the intended response lies in the principle rather than a literal set:\n\n**Answer Formatted:**\nGiven the unique application of terms and the unavailability of a strict, direct listing within the constraints of [m0] format without further clarification, directly responding in the requested [item] format for \"all possible true assignments\" across 4 variables would be seen as \"potentially [Listing All 16 m0 Terms] or under the constraint of format, through explanation that it represents a comprehensive truth assignment set\".

        "response": "Given the logic and definitions provided, let's address the question step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the requirement**: The question asks us to identify a logical expression when a proposition `p` is the consensus of the group `G` but individual Alice doubts this proposition.\n\n2. **Definition of consensus**: A proposition `p` being the consensus of the group `G` implies that it is a common belief within `G`. According to our definitions:\n\n    \\[\n    p \\text{ is a common belief in } G \\rightarrow G_p\n    \\]\n\n    This expression shows that for all members of the group `G`, including Alice, it must be that they firmly believe `p`. \n\n3. **Alice's doubt**: It's stated that Alice, an individual within this group `G`, doubts proposition `p`. According to our definitions:\n\n    \\[\n    H_p \\rightarrow \\neg B_p\n    \\]\n\n    This indicates that if Alice doubts `p`, then by definition, she does not firmly believe `p`.\n\n4. **Combining these into a logical expression**: The consensus of the group `G` on proposition `p` conflicts with Alice's doubt. We denote this as a situation not aligned with the definition of common belief within a group when applied specifically to Alice. In terms of propositions, this involves both Alice firmly believing the negation of `p` (`\\(\\neg B_p\\)`) and the fact that `p` is indeed a common belief (`\\(G_p\\)`) within the group under consideration. However, the question specifically asks for how this would be represented given it's not the case that Alice believes in `p` being the consensus; rather, the focus is on the doubt concerning `p`.\n\nTherefore, a logical expression expressing the desired situation (consensus as common belief group-wide but individual Alice's doubt):\n\n\\[\n\\text{For } p \\text{ being consensus of group } G \\text{ and Alice doubting } p: \\neg G_p \\vee \\text{Alice's beliefs}\n\\]\n\nThis expression (~\\(!G_p~\\)) indicates that proposition \\(p\\) is not a common belief in group \\(G\\) from Alice's perspective. In traditional logical notation, this is represented as \\(\\neg G_p\\), which stands for \"not \\(G_p\\)\" or \"it is not the case that \\(p\\) is a common belief in \\(G\\)\".\n\nIn the requested format [[]], we'll encapsulate this understanding more directly addressing the inquiry in terms of logical symbols specified in the cognitive logic formulation provided by the original:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg G_p \\wedge H_p]\n\\]\n\nHere, the inner part of the brackets indicates that `p` is not a common belief in the group `G` (encoded as \\(\\neg G_p\\)) and Alice doubts `p` (encoded as `H_p`). However, it seems a discrepancy might've been intended between the explanation and the precise logical formulation based on the given rules (`G_p` indicates common belief which, given Alice's doubt, intuitively suggests she does not 'fit' into a common belief scenario regarding `p` if we interpret things strictly within the world of `G_p` designation as used here). The clarification of explicitly linking this back to Alice's individual status (`Alice's beliefs`) seems crucial in aligning the logical expression with an assessment grounded in individual belief statuses.\n\nGiven this review of specifications and the aim for output conformity to the provided formulation guidelines, the enhanced and more interpretable logical expression vertically could reflect to sum up the key insights into Alice's differing belief dynamics from the consensus standards, aligning closer to a more granular expression of her perspective within the broader definitions of beliefs and dought provided:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg G_p \\wedge H_p] = [\\neg (B_{G_p}) \\wedge H_{Alice}]\n\\]\n\nThus anarchically, the final annotation aligned to fulfill both the core logical expression derivation and description of the cognitive environment in line with the supplied axioms and definition is:\n\n\\[\n[\\neg (B_{G_p}) \\wedge H_{Alice}]\n\\]",
