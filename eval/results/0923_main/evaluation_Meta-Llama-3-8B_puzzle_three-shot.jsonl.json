Prefixes are commonly used to provide additional meaning to words, as in removing cancer (prefix \"re\") or bringing sunshine (prefix \"sun\"). In this case, the rule requires that a common prefix be added before these letter combinations to form meaningful words.\n\nSince one of the letter combinations is \"blem,\" the prefix \"def\" is inserted before it to form the word \"def vend, which means something close to healthy. This is a close match to one of the positive connotations of a 'common prefix' addition, and therefore it is selected as the answer.",

Level 1:\n\n[[[[[[[deny]]]]] end [[[[[[eni]]] ned]]]]]]\n2.Level 2:\n\n[[[[[[rout]] tour [[[[[ret]]]rout]]]]]]\n3.Level 3:\n\n[[[[next]] [[tet]] [[ten]] [[tern]]]]\n4.Level 4:\n\n[[[[[au]][[to]]t  [[au]]toun [[atu]]t]]]\n5.Level 5:\n\n[[[[is]]ss [[isee]] sest [neat [[dream]]er]]]]\n\n\n### Answer\nIn level 1, the provided letters are E N D and the number and length of required words are 3 words: 3 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter. To solve this puzzle, the player needs to use the letters E N D to spell the words den, end, and ned. The answer [[den end ned]] is formed by combining these three words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the second level, the provided letters are T O U R and the required words are 3 words: 4 letter, 4 letter, 4 letter. The player needs to use the letters T O U R to spell rout, tour, and rout. The answer [[rout tour rout]] comes from concatenating these words with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the third level, the provided letters are N E X T and the required words are 4 words: 4 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter, 3 letter. The player needs to use the letters N E X T to spell next, tex, net, and ten. The answer [[next tex net ten]] is formed by concatenating these four words, with each word separated by a space.\n\nIn the fourth level, the letters are U N T A and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, 4 letters. The player can use U N T A to spell auto, aout, and aton, and the answer [[auto aout aton]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space. However, this answer violates the rule about the lengths of the words. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required and the first two words have three and four characters respectively.\n\nAt level 5, the letters I N C R E A S E and the requirement is 5 words, all having 4 letters. The player can use this set of letters to form the words in see, neat, sane, issue, and tese. The answer [[insee neat sane issue tese]] is a concatenation of these words separated by a space.\n\nFor the last question, the letters are S M O K E and the required words are 3 words: 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters, respectively. The player can construct [[smoke makes make]] by using these letters. The two words \"smoke\" and \"makes\" have four characters and the word \"make\" has three characters. Although the lengths of the first and second words match the requirement, the third word does not. The rule states that 3 words, 4 letters, 4 letters, and 4 letters are required in the final answer.\n\n\nNote: There were six test cases in the puzzle. I solved all six test cases. \n\n\n",

The urls should be separated by either spaces or\ncommas. The list returned must contain strings. Every string in the list\nreturned should only contain the url with no spaces, commas, brackets,\nnewlines or brackets. Newlines in input strings will occur and can be\nfiltered. This is to save space and increase efficiency. Example Inputs:\n\n'# Space separated http'\n'http://www.python.org http://www.codecademy.com'\n'money.cnn.com/recentnews/top/1.article'\n'http://hello-world-web-cms/github.com/sample/Index.html?Hello-Page=code'\n\n### Answer:\n```def get_urls(html):\n    lst = re.findall(r'(?:https?:\\/\\/)(?:\\w+.)+(?:\\w+)(?:\\S)', html)\n    # replace escape characters :\n    lst = [re.sub('[\\],\\\\tags[]\\']', '', t) for t in lst]\n    return lst\n```\n\n### Question:\nUse control flow statements in any form to get the shortest running time.\nGiven three integers, a, b and c.

If there are multiple clues to the same row or column, they must be solved using the clues provided. For example, conditional statements such as A+B = X, L+R = X must resolve into unique equation pairs when X is given. This means that if two clues overlap in a single row or column, the equation pairs must be solved for the values of A, B, L, and R to provide unique solutions.\n\nHow many grid sizes does the puzzle support?\nThe puzzle supports 7 different N X N grid sizes: 2*2 to 8*8. Puzzles can contain multiple smaller components which, when joined together, form a complete puzzle.\n\nWhat is the relationship between the grid size and the number of columns/rows?\nThe rows/columns of the grid are uniformly divided into regions and each region is obtained by dividing the grid into multiple rows and multiple columns. Each grid size indicates an N X N matrix, where N can have the following values: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Therefore, the maximum number of grid regions is (N*2)^2 and the minimum number of grid regions is (N*2)^2-1. \n\nWhat is the relationship between the grid size and the core puzzle concentrations?\nThe core puzzle concentrations are evenly distributed into the uniformly divided grid regions. The larger the grid size, the more different puzzle concentrations are generated.\n\nUnderstanding The Pattern: Solving Custom Puzzles Using Logical Reasoning and Programming Skills\nApproximately 50-55% of custom puzzles do not contain clues, while around 40-45% have missing clues. In both types of puzzles, your goal is to solve the puzzle using logical reasoning and programming skills.\n\nTo identify patterns in the missing clues, you can first identify the regions where the target element is located and then determine which rule (such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or others defined in the puzzle) is applied in the region. You can start by attempting to determine if two of the missing clues are relatively easy to guess or if they are more complex to solve. If there are fewer missing clues, try to use a logical reasoning approach. \n\nIf there are multiple clues, begin by compiling the results of the calculations for the known clues. Break down these calculations into smaller components, and for each smaller component, categorize them into certain types of expressions (e.g., division or multiplication) where the target element is added on and in which order they are arranged. Use the preceding patterns to identify the location of the unknown targets. The clues may need to be rewritten multiple times.",

Understanding the problem requirements, constraints, and input/output formats can significantly impact the time spent solving a challenge and possibly even the solution efficiency.\n* To illustrate, let's consider a case study presented as a 3x3 chessboard. At specific chessboard cell locations, a knight(“K”) and queen (‘Q’) can attack each other. We wish to move either knight or queen to an unoccupied location on the chessboard without breaking the attacking relationship between them. Alternatively, if no unoccupied location like this exists, we must move either one of them outside of the chessboard.\n# Assumptions and Known Information\n* Knight can travel any 2 positions up/down if the position is on the row directly adjacent to the knight and only one position to either piece or row, separated by a wall or road, depending on the land type. Additionally, assume all roads on the chessboard are the same.\n* The queen can move any number of rows and columns provided an unoccupied space is available in its path.\n# Example Findings\n* An initial consultation with users(“U”) revealed a problem statement with a predefined chessboard board of X size, where X ≦ 8.\nAdditionally, U provides the initial location of the knight(“NK”) and queen (“NQ”) points on the board.\n* User inputs consist of two components within the “input caterpillar”: NU and Nkinght for NK and NQueen for NQ. A “caterpillar” separates the input components. Three commas separate the input components.\n* If Ninputs = only 1 Knight or only 1 Queen, the specialize function is not called.\n* If NU ≠ 0 from the input, it is an NC, so it is transformed into a separate code without involving “F().\n* The matrix check function verifies that all inputs are integers. Ai is transformed into A3 by subtracting A*T, and A ≥ 5 converted to a1.\n* The full equation after all transformations is given as follows:\nA=a0+a1+a2+a3+a4+a5+a6+a7\n* Specifically, “buffer” was used as the power variable in the above calculation, with the maximum value assigned as N.\n# Process Flow\n* We will proceed in the following manner:\n* Check for corner case conditions\n* Consulting the user\n* Assuming valid inputs\n* Implementing mathematical transformations through recopying and reshaping\n* Validating results\n* Making entries\n# Discussion\n* Failing to comprehend the problem entirely could possibly lead to time-consuming rescrambling. Strive to grasp the underlying concepts before beginning to tackle the challenge.\n* Besides this, caring for users' needs can benefit both parties. Delve into the users' role and establish a better frame of reference.\n* Recopying and reshaping can assist in transforming model inputs more efficiently, enhancing the transformation process and allowing more time for modelling adjustments and validation.\n# Solution Approach\n* Ensure that assumptions derived from users' feedback are incorporated into the problem-solving framework.\n* If the assumptions are in compliance, utilize the specialist code to verify the desired results and select the right checking code.\n* It is crucial to validate the results of the approach, as any deviation can impact the utility of the solution.\n",

It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\n### Sample Input 4\nInput 4: Your name-your level-Assigned earl position-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 4\nWhen the earl says: The Output will be different from his input depending on where he's moving or how many times can be generated. It should be captured as a whole, and he should be chosen knowingly purposes.\n\nYou have\n: your name\nlevel: your assigned earl level (1-5)\nAssigned earl location: Assigned earl position of (x, y, z) mentally, but (y, z, x) or (x comma, y comma) or just followed the chart of your assignment. Or just a chart with the fixing charts like one of those fields of connections! (sorry I am panicking a lot because I am so bad at this)\nrun(x): the count of earl's moves with x as y or anywhere on the outer field. When completed, this must be written in the earl's system output.\n\n### Output\nOxygen is created everywhere around the Earl\nIf available Earl states the position of things like an exponential decay type of vector thing, but it creates scattered oxygen (that's just a word).\n1B means o2 gas generator that generates 1 for every 1 time earl move and it becomes 0 after 3 times it was activated.\n2 at the end means earl wanted to know the location, so the position of the surface (0,0,0) and the oxygen' pool if there are loops around earl so he asks immediately after each exhale.\nScattered is a word that's just an example.\nIf there are contradictions for contract and contract, please refer to the sense of \"contracting\" but a negative number could be positive but it doesn't matter which way how though its an array of the same array as an input, that it is converted to an integer into a string, and the changes are stored as \"You should be able to traverse the array in a certain way depending on space\" to explain which one gives him the new position. (x,y) In the orientation of the swarm.\n\n### Explanation:    \nsmall description from earl, just to have some knowledge of the given rules to understand\n\n### Approach\nEarl states that the position of the oxygen generators are to be reported from the position of the input value.\nHe states: The scattered oxygen each will be created when the hearl gets\nInput: any 3D vector x,y,z (Just a string of chars)\nEarl stated that the input should include at least 2 strings, or 6 numbers.\nEarl is able to make use of movement commands to change his position, If only one rare element exists it can be hard to find,\nand the earl is never going to change his position.\nEarl is able to move around the place with the earl's measurements, using the oxygen releases and earl's reactions to oxygen gas (gas generator drops)\nor oxygen gas (scattered gas increased)\nOxygen gas (oxygen gas release drops) or oxygen gas (scattered gas decreases)\noxygen gas (scattered) or a number\nEarl verify if he gets the location (position) that it should be possible to do that without navigation mechanisms\nOxygen scattered earl says that earl has the following 2 locations, and hearl means \"Earl's until…\" the oxygen the useful thing to do\nto be able to do is in the kitbag, if hearl\nhas a previous true true value.\n\n### Sample Input\nInput 1 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 2 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 3 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 4 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nInput 5 : Your name-your level-Assigned earl location-run (number of time to simulate the earl moving)\n\nSample Output 1 :\nThe input is 1 and the output is earl's position, but earl will get located inside of the earl with the \"earl's location\" \nwhere earl is located with location of the input (x,y,z). (it's not in 2D though, so there's a lot of theoretical possibilities like if earl moves in 3D)\n\n\nSample Output 2 : \n\nOutput Explanation:\n",

If needed, make edits to improve your algorithm and efficiency.\n\nPlease have a copy of the tests for reference.\n\nSome tips for refining your solutions:\n\n1. Take advantage of built-in Python functions. Python offers many built-in functions, like sum(), min(), and max(), that can be used to simplify code and reduce repetition.\n2. Consider writing separate functions for specific tasks. Breaking down codes into smaller, manageable parts can make it easier to write and debug code.\n3. Check for precedence issues. Incorrectly placing parentheses can significantly impact the result of an equation.\n4. Consider using dictionaries. Dictionaries can help keep track of key items that need to be stored and retrieved efficiently.\n\nCan you write a Python program that can recognize numbers in a sequence?\n1. Use arrays to store numbers\n2. Use an iterative method to compare an element with the next two elements\n3.

Your task is to write a Python program that can preprocess the unencrypted exam screenplay you get, so that you can decrypt it on an exam terminal. All exam terminals are designed to be quite fast, so decryption must be speedy. To get the specs of your terminal, use the function test_terminal(). To submit a terminal as your answer to seeds, use github: calc_exam or use the page form here. Click on \"Submit Exam Answer\", instead of the other red one.\n\n# Coding\n\nExercise 1 No Pain, No Gain\n\nYou have a knitting machine that can produce a square piece of woolen fabric at the rate of one row per second. On day one, you knit a fabric with a side length of one centimeter. Every day, you cheerfully enlarge the fabric by 50% of its side length. The 50% enlargement then becomes the new side length on day 2. After 20 days, the woolen fabric measures 255 cm, or you could say, 42 inches.\n\nCalculate the number of hours required to create this fabric.\n\nFull Title:    No Pain, No Gain\n\nOne-word answer:\n\nExtra points:    Emphatically true (Words to Ponder).   Extra points:    Emphatically false (Words to Ponder).\n\nExtra points:    True (Choose a title)\n\nExtra points:    False (Choose a title)\n\nExercise 2 Jump over the fence\n\nA man has built a fence around his house. Because he was kind of drunk when he did so, he placed the poles exactly a meter apart. Using 16 poles, he managed to cover the square two-dimensional part of the house. Before the sun rises, his son James has passed the night as a road worker and has constructed a wall. However, it turns out his wall can't meet the requirements of the laws about road maintenance, since the fences on the adjacent roads collide. The result of James's hard work has now become a third of a square meter.\n\n### Question:\n\nIn the morning, before the sun rises, we need to understand how the fence made by James will look like.\n\n### Instructions:\n\nStudy the problem described. Break down the task into subtasks. Use the appropriate tools and resources to solve the issue.\n\nIf needed, conduct research on any unknown concepts or terminology.\n\nUse awareness of the bigger picture to direct your approach in solving the issue.\n\nProvide a comprehensive solution in code. Testing and debugging may be required.\n\nDescription of the solution, including advanced considerations or trade-offs (if necessary).\n\n### Code:\n\nThe above code is run using the command \"g++ -w jump.cpp -o jump;\" followed by \"./jump\".\n\n### Answer:\n\ncode for the above task The output will be this image\n\nExercise 3 Minimum path\n\n# Game Theories\n\nGame Theory is the form of mathematics and the science that deals with strategic decision making. The focus is on optimal strategies to maximize the expected rewards in competitive circumstances or cooperative schemes.\n\nGame theory can make a prediction on what one will do in accordance with the anticipated output of the opponents. We identify these participants as players in the game in which the rewards or payoffs are attached to the strategy they follow. Knowledge about the expected goals of the other players and access to information about the strategy they are following is paramount when playing a game.\n\nGame Theory is a fundamental concept in mathematics. It is useful in numerous applications, such as in businesses and economics, sports, and the social sciences. It can also be used to analyze wars, politics, and other interplay activities. While there are many types of games, in game theory, they are classified into three categories  based on their payoff structure– Cooperative, Non-cooperative, and Dynamic.\n\n• Exercises Test\n• Logic Gates\n• Programming\n• Simplifying Boolean Expression\n• Grinder",
